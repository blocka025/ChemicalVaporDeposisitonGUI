# ChemicalVaporDeposisitonGUI

This is the software that I wrote from scratch during a ten week REU at Cornell University in the summer of 2022.

This is a MatLab based application that acts as a graphical user interface that allows remote control of a Chemical Vapor Deposisiton apparatus that deposisits Nb3Sn on the surface of Nb radio-frequency superconducting cavities.
It was not entirely finished due to missing hardware during my short 10 week stay in Ithaca.
